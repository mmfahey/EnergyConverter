# Spectrochemical Energy Converter

## Description
Command-line tool written in python that allows scientists to quickly and easily convert common energy units used.

## Project Status
This project has been expanded to be used on mobile platforms as opposed to being used as a command line tool. This project will be updated with added units that are included or added to the mobile app.

## Installation
Must have python installed on PC/linux and the EnergyConversions.py saved in parent directory to use conversions.

## Usage

'''python 
import EnergyConversions

#converts 5 eV to wavenumbers
EnergyConversions.convert2wavenumber('eV', 5)

#converts 200 nm to eV
EnergyConversions.convert2eV('nm', 200)
'''
